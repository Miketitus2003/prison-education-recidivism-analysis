# Prison Education & Recidivism Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between prison education programs and recidivism rates. Because direct participation data in education programs wasn't available in the primary dataset, post-release employment was used as a proxy for successful program participation. The analysis uses simulated data modeled after trends in Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Simulated a dataset with 1,000 observations using key indicators: post-release employment, violent offense history, and time served.
- Used logistic regression to model the likelihood of recidivism based on these predictors.
- Generated charts and coefficient plots to visualize key findings.

## 📊 Key Results
- Employment after release significantly lowers the odds of recidivism.
- Violent offenses increase the likelihood of reoffending.
- Time served had no meaningful impact in the simulation.
